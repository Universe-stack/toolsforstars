[x] Project Setup:

 Initialize a new Node.js project (npm init).
 Install necessary dependencies (express, mongoose, etc.).
 Set up your directory structure.
 Create configuration files (package.json, .env, etc.).
 Database Setup:

[x] Set up your database (MongoDB) and connect to it.
[x] Define database schemas/models (User, Tool, Review, Upvote, etc.).
[x] Implement CRUD operations for database interactions.
[x] Authentication and Authorization:

[x] Implement user authentication (register, login) using Google OAuth or other methods.
[x] Set up authorization middleware to protect routes (e.g., admin routes, user-specific routes).

API Routes:

[x] Define API routes for user-related operations (register, login, profile management).
[x] Define API routes for tool-related operations (listing tools, adding tools, managing tools).
[x] Define API routes for review and upvote operations (submitting reviews, upvoting tools).

Error Handling:

[x] Implement error handling middleware to catch and handle errors globally.
[x] Define error response formats and status codes for different types of errors.

Validation:

[x] Implement input validation middleware to validate incoming request data.
[x] Validate user input (e.g., email format, password strength).
[x] Validate tool-related input (e.g., required fields, data formats).

Middleware:

[x] Implement middleware for common tasks (logging, request/response manipulation, etc.).
[x] Use middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., authentication, authorization).

Testing:

[x] Write unit tests for your API routes and middleware functions.
[x] Use testing frameworks (e.g., Mocha, Jest) and assertion libraries (e.g., Chai, Jest) for testing.
Documentation:

[x] Document your API endpoints (URLs, request/response formats, parameters, etc.).
[x] Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.

Security:

[x] Implement security best practices (e.g., secure password storage, data encryption).
[x] Protect against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks).

Deployment:

[x] Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
[x] Configure deployment settings (environment variables, database connection strings).
[x] Deploy your Express.js application to a production environment.

Monitoring and Logging:

[x] Set up logging to track application events and errors.
[x] Implement monitoring solutions (e.g., health checks, performance monitoring).
